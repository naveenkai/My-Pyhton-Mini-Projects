#Number Guessing Game using Python
#To create a guessing game, we need to write a program to select a random number between 1 and 10. 
#To give hints to the user, we can use conditional statements to tell the user if the guessed number is smaller, 
#greater than or equal to the randomly selected number.

import random
n = random.randrange(1,10)
guess = int(input("Enter any number: "))
while n!= guess:
    if guess < n:
        print("Too low")
        guess = int(input("Enter number again: "))
    elif guess > n:
        print("Too high!")
        guess = int(input("Enter number again: "))
    else:
      break
print("you guessed it right!!")
